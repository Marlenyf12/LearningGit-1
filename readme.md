#What is Git
Git is a version control software, that keeps track of our software/code, it maintains the history and changes of our projects. We can also have numerous versions of our code simultaniously.

#Initializing a Git repository
Starting our Git repo, to begin maintaining our project's version history.

#Git Commit
A commit is a checkpoint that represents and holds our code at that point in our project's history. We can always revert to a previous commit to undo any changes. Usually used to store a significant change in our project.

#Git and Github
Keep in mind that Git and Github are two different things. Git is a version control software that can be used on your computer, certain text editors/ides and it's what Github uses behind the scenes to maintain your code. Github is a remote service that holds your Git repos.
